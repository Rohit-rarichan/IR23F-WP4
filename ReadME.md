# Workout project 4
# Rohit George Rarichan
This workout project asks us to retrieve data from a Web API and the plot the data that we retrieve on to a graph using plotly module. 

In this project I have used 4 files that is API, file_io, visualization, user_interface. 

API: contains the function that gets data from the API. 
file_io: contains the function that takes advantage of the json module and dumps the data onto a file
visualization: it contains the function that creates the graph based on the data given by the API file.
user_interface: this is the file that contains the user interface and manages all the data.
